Sounds of Change trains people that work with communities living in challenging circumstances. For these people, words often are not enough to express themselves. To deal with heavy emotions, and feel safe again, another approach is needed. Music bonds people and is a powerful tool to express yourself  in a different way than with words.

Making music stimulates creativity and appeals to the imagination. Composing and creating music leads to discovering other possibilities, and it strengthens coping mechanisms. Being creative also awakens the understanding that there are always opportunities to build a future. Even if you are living in the middle of war, a devastated city or in a refugee camp.
